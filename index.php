	I'm a Full Stack Developer / Game Developer / Music Producer in the Los Angeles area. Most recently I worked at Microsoft in the group that maintains <a href='https://zone.msn.com/en-us/home' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>zone.msn.com</a>.

	<p>Previously, I worked at <a href='https://pop.in/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Pop.in</a> and helped create a new internal game platform for 2021’s app relaunch. Our team developed six online multiplayer games with videos livestreamed from players. I've also created two HTML5 games with 138,000 and 29,000 plays, and I co-managed the IT web development team during my time working at a highly-ranked STEM college.</p>

	<p>During the early years of the iOS App Store I was a lead developer for a <a href='https://www.bovinedragonsoftware.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>startup</a> that created <a href ="https://toucharcade.com/2013/09/30/trace-2-review-years-ahead-of-the-first-game/" target='_blank' rel="noopener">three</a> <a href ="https://web.archive.org/web/20190211195412/http://www.slidetoplay.com/gomi-review/" target='_blank' rel="noopener">awesome</a> <a href='https://toucharcade.com/2008/10/08/spacecowmusics-trace-finally-hits-the-app-store/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>games</a>. Our most successful product was installed over 4.8 million times and was showcased for years in Apple’s internal developer site as the definitive free iOS game.</p>

	<p>And I'm an audio engineer with a Bachelor's Degree in composing electronic music. This is just a hobby now, but I'm a perfect fit if you have any plans for building something with a sound/music focus!</p>
