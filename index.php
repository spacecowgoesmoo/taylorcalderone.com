	My name is Taylor Calderone and I'm a Game Developer / Full Stack Developer / Music Producer living in the Los Angeles area.

	<p>I was a lead developer for a <a href='http://www.bovinedragonsoftware.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>startup</a> that created <a href ="https://toucharcade.com/2013/09/30/trace-2-review-years-ahead-of-the-first-game/" target='_blank' rel="noopener">three</a> <a href ="https://web.archive.org/web/20190211195412/http://www.slidetoplay.com/gomi-review/" target='_blank' rel="noopener">awesome</a> <a href='https://toucharcade.com/2008/10/08/spacecowmusics-trace-finally-hits-the-app-store/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>games</a> during the early years of the iOS App Store. Our most successful product was installed over 4.8 million times and was showcased for years in Appleâ€™s internal developer site as the definitive free iOS game.</p>

	<p>I'm also experienced in HTML5 game development and web / digital audio. My background here includes two more online games with 138,000 and 29,000 plays, and I co-managed the IT web development team during my time working at a highly-ranked STEM college.</p>
